# AMPL mode

This project provides an Emacs major mode, `ampl-mode` for editing AMPL model and
data files. This mode provides an alias of `ampl-mode` called
`mathprog-mode`, as the GNU MathProg language is largely compatible
with AMPL syntax.

This mode currently supports basic syntax highlighting and
indentation.
